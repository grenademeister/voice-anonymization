# voice-anonymization

A starting repository for research and tools to perform voice anonymization — transforming or masking speaker identity while preserving speech content and naturalness.

This repository is being initialized with a minimal project structure. Future additions may include anonymization pipelines, pretrained models, example scripts, and evaluation tools.

Quick start

1. Clone the repository

   git clone https://github.com/grenademeister/voice-anonymization.git
   cd voice-anonymization

2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment

   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux / macOS
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

3. Install dependencies (when provided)

   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run example (when added)

   python scripts/anonymize.py --input examples/input.wav --output examples/output_anonymized.wav
